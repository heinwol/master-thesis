The previous study by the second author established the existence of phase transition from small components to a linear (in $\frac{n}{d}$) sized component, at $p=\frac{1}{d}$. In the supercritical regime, our main result recovers the sharp asymptotic of the size of the largest component, and shows that all other components are typically much smaller. Furthermore, we consider other typical properties of the largest component such as the number of edges, existence of a long cycle and expansion. In the subcritical regime, we strengthen the upper bound on the likely component size.},

We prove mean-field behavior around the critical probability p_c=1/(d-1). In particular, we show that there is a scaling window of width n^{-1/3} around p_c in which the sizes of the largest components are roughly n^{2/3} and we describe their limiting joint distribution. We also show that for the subcritical regime, i.e. p = (1-eps(n))p_c where eps(n)=o(1) but \eps(n)n^{1/3} tends to infinity, the sizes of the largest components are concentrated around an explicit function of n and eps(n) which is of order o(n^{2/3}). In the supercritical regime, i.e. p = (1+\eps(n))p_c where eps(n)=o(1) but eps(n)n^{1/3} tends to infinity, the size of the largest component is concentrated around the value (2d/(d-2))\eps(n)n and a duality principle holds: other component sizes are distributed as in the subcritical regime.},

This extends known results for fixed $d\geq 3$ and for $d=n-1$, confirming a prediction of Nachmias and Peres on a question of Benjamini. As a corollary, for the largest component of the percolated random $d$-regular graph, we also determine the diameter and the mixing time of the lazy random walk. In contrast to previous approaches, our proof is based on a simple application of the switching method.},

  abstract      = {In most studies, street networks are considered as undirected graphs while one-way streets and their effect on shortest paths are usually ignored. Here, we first study the empirical effect of one-way streets in about $140$ cities in the world. Their presence induces a detour that persists over a wide range of distances and characterized by a non-universal exponent. The effect of one-ways on the pattern of shortest paths is then twofold: they mitigate local traffic in certain areas but create bottlenecks elsewhere. This empirical study leads naturally to consider a mixed graph model of 2d regular lattices with both undirected links and a diluted variable fraction $p$ of randomly directed links which mimics the presence of one-ways in a street network. We study the size of the strongly connected component (SCC) versus $p$ and demonstrate the existence of a threshold $p_c$ above which the SCC size is zero. We show numerically that this transition is non-trivial for lattices with degree less than $4$ and provide some analytical argument. We compute numerically the critical exponents for this transition and confirm previous results showing that they define a new universality class different from both the directed and standard percolation. Finally, we show that the transition on real-world graphs can be understood with random perturbations of regular lattices. The impact of one-ways on the graph properties were already the subject of a few mathematical studies, and our results show that this problem has also interesting connections with percolation, a classical model in statistical physics.},

  abstract      = {Mathematical models of motility are often based on random-walk descriptions of discrete individuals that can move according to certain rules. It is usually the case that large masses concentrated in small regions of space have a great impact on the collective movement of the group. For this reason, many models in mathematical biology have incorporated crowding effects and managed to understand their implications. Here, we build on a previously developed framework for random walks on networks to show that in the continuum limit, the underlying stochastic process can be identified with a diffusion partial differential equation. The diffusion coefficient of the emerging equation is in general density-dependent, and can be directly related to the transition probabilities of the random walk. Moreover, the relaxation time of the stochastic process is directly linked to the diffusion coefficient and also to the network structure, as it usually happens in the case of linear diffusion. As a specific example, we study the equivalent of a porous-medium type equation on networks, which shows similar properties to its continuum equivalent. For this equation, self-similar solutions on a lattice and on homogeneous trees can be found, showing finite speed of propagation in contrast to commonly used linear diffusion equations. These findings also provide insights into reaction-diffusion systems with general diffusion operators, which have appeared recently in some applications.},
